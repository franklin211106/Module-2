# BUILT FUNCTIONS AND LOOPING PATTERN
# AIM:
to write a python program to operate input using built-in-functions.

# ALGORITHM:
1)Define a lambda function f:

f = lambda z: z * 45
This creates an anonymous function f that takes one argument z and returns z * 45.

2)Take user input:

i = int(input())
Reads input from the user as a string, then converts it into an integer and stores it in i.

3)Apply the function and print result:

print(f(i))
Calls the lambda function f with the input value i, calculates i * 45, and prints the result.

# PROGRAM:
```
f= lambda z:z*45
i=int(input())
print(f(i))
```

# OUTPUT:

# RESULT:
The expected output is acheived
